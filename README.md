Online Shopping Website
The purpose of our project is to create a online shopping site which displays a variety of products and allows the user to pick the items which they wish to purchase the items would then be inserted into a shopping cart which would calculate the total amount and allow the user to purchase the goods. The website utilized a series of txt files to retrieve the various items which were sold in the online store. The items were displayed via a php loop into a number of different php files corresponding to items type (i.e: Dairy, Deli, Produce, Dry Goods, Frozen). The item sold upon being pulled from the text file receives a php name and price. This information is later sent, when the addtocart() button is pressed, to the shoppingcart.js file. Our shopping cart utilizes local storage to keep track of items selected and to find the total cost of the items.
